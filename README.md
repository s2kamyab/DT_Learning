# DT_Learning
Matlab code for Learning  DT of metrics using new objective for classification of MNIST dataset
Run DT_learning.m
gradient_m.m, gradient_w.m : gradient of objective with respect to variables W(D2xD1), m(D1x1).
Tree_Growing.m is a recursive function to apply ID3 algorithm using proposed objective
